// FixedReader implements a buffered reader that always reads a fixed amount
// of data from an underlying io.Reader.
//
// It is intended to produce a stream from a packet-based network socket, such
// as net.UDPConn.
//
// Note that packet-based sockets normally give no guarantee about the order of
// incoming packets, and don't account for resends of dropped ones.
// If order is important, reordering must be implemented by other means.
//
// If the underlying reader implements the io.Closer interface, Close() calls
// will be forwarded. Otherwise, Close() is a no-op.
